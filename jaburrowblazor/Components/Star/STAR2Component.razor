                A requirement to send information to and receive information from a third party company.
                There was no specification in my company regarding what this should look like and
                very basic (and somewhat inaccurate) documentation as to the third party’s systems.

                Additionally there was no UI specified for colleagues in my company to view
                or action the information returned from the third party.

                Create a command line application to send information to the third party –
                plus I identified that the information returned was useless to my colleagues
                in the business without UI for viewing and taking action on the returned information.

                The information was originally to be sent to an API but it was discovered at the last
                moment that the API was not production ready so I rewrote the code to send the
                information in .CSV files via ftp.

            <MudText>
                As there was no mention of any UI I identified a need for same and wrote a Blazor application
                enabling the business to view the returned information and to take action to
                resend the files which had not been processed (and therefore returned as ‘failed’) to the third party.

                I successfully created a command line application that sent information

                I created a Blazor application to display the results of the send and receive
                actions and allow colleagues in the business to take required actions.

            <MudText>
                As I was the only person in the company with Blazor experience I mentored
                colleagues in the use of this technology and helped by means of demonstrations
                and paired / tripled programming tuition to upskill them.
