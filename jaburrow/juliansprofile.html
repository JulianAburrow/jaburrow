            <h5>01/2025 - Date : Studying and up-skilling</h5>

            <p>
                I have been using my time for full-time job hunting and up-skilling myself – most notably building an application using AWS (Localstack DynamoDb and S3 and MinIO)
                cloud technologies and learning Playwright, Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, RAG AI with Ollama and various local LLMs.
            </p>

            <h5>04/2023 - 12/2024 : STM Group - C# ASP.NET SQL Server Blazor Senior Developer</h5>

            <p>A permanent role. I worked on a complex Blazor / MudBlazor / Identity Server application for which I had sole design and development responsibility.</p>

            <p>More details can be found here: <a href="http://www.jaburrow.co.uk/CaseStudies" title="Case Studies STAR#1">Case Studies STAR #1</a></p>

            <p>I also designed and built a console application to exchange information with a third party and persist the results to a database for display in a Blazor / MudBlazor application.</p>

            <p>More details can be found here: <a href="http://www.jaburrow.co.uk/CaseStudies" title="Case Studies STAR#2">Case Studies STAR #2</a></p>

            <p>I trained and mentored colleagues as I was the department subject matter expert in these technologies.</p>

            <h5>12/21 - 3/23 : Powwr - C# ASP.NET SQL Server Web Application Developer</h5>

            <p>
                A permanent role involving bug fixing and enhancements in a large and complex web application. I also
                created a proof of concept Blazor application and demonstrated this to senior management.
            </p>

            <h5>05/21 - 12/21 : Stepstone Ltd - Full Stack Developer</h5>

            <p>
                A permanent role involving change requests for various aspects of the company's job websites.
                This involved C# WebAPI, Unit tests, Moq, React components and a variety of other work.
            </p>

            <h5>11/18 - 09/19 : NATS - C# ASP.NET SQL Server Web Application Developer</h5>

            <p>
                A contract to develop several applications involving change requests. The most complex of these applications involved six or so stages.
                I built up very good relationships with the stakeholders for these applications and also wrote detailed documentation for each of the applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                I introduced the team to Entity Framework, provided multiple EF demonstrations to the team members both as a group and individually,
                created an EF training application to enable the team to learn how the applications that I created work and assisted other developers with their code.
            </p>
            <p>In a department still using very old style ADO.Net spaghetti code I tried to introduce best practice to reduce the overall codebase and improve code performance.</p>

            <h5>03/18 – 08/18 : Marston Book Services Ltd – C# ASP.NET SQL Server Web Application Developer</h5>

            <p>I was invited back to Marston to assist with preparations for GDPR readiness and a project to implement real-time synchronisation with a third party database.</p>

            <p>In addition to this I carried out bug fixes and change requests and continued streamlining the application.</p>

            <h5>03/16 – 11/17 : Marston Book Services Ltd – C# ASP.NET SQL Server Web Application Developer</h5>

            <p>During this contract at Marston I introduced multiple changes to the application:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Implemented Entity Framework.</li>
                <li>Removed almost every stored procedure from the database and replaced them with Linq in the application.</li>
                <li>Added a metadata class for every business object to facilitate validation via data annotation and to consolidate error messages into one location.</li>
                <li>Added a class to contain the configuration code for every business object.</li>
                <li>Moved validation logic (which could not be achieved via data annotation) to the business objects.</li>
                <li>Integrated Google Maps functionality, geocoding addresses as they are added.</li>
                <li>Introduced Table Per Hierarchy for objects where possible.</li>
                <li>Added auditing on a per field level.</li>
                <li>Created view models for logical groups of properties which did not exist in one object (company plus address, for example).</li>
                <li>Created further user controls for commonly used functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition to the above I carried out general ongoing feature enhancements and bug fixes and worked to reduce the code overhead wherever possible.</p>

            <h5>01/14 - 07/15 : Marston Book Services Ltd – C# ASP.NET SQL Server Web Application Developer</h5>

            <p>
                I was invited back to Marston to assist with adding functionality to one of the company's mission critical applications. Amendments included those required to enable the application
                to comply with new European VAT regulations. I also:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduced the number of stored procedures by replacing ‘CheckForExisting’ stored procedures with Linq statements in the front end.</li>
                <li>Added abstract classes for the two types of user control (one for managing objects, the other for displaying information in gridviews).</li>
                <li>
                    Created views in the database to correspond to all objects within the application and ensured that the objects did not contain any member variables
                    that did not correspond to a column in the view.
                </li>
                <li>Added Routing to the application.</li>
                <li>Added the basis of a route based sitemap provider to enable the insertion of object Ids into breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li>
                    Reduced coding overhead by almost two thirds by replacing separate ‘Add’, ‘View’ and ‘Update’ pages with one UserControl, which used an
                    enum to set the state of the page.
                </li>
                <li>Introduced ModelBinding to the application which further reduced the amount of code and enabled the sorting (and paging if required) of gridviews.</li>
                <li>Introduced DataAnnotation to the objects to enable the use of ModelValidation.</li>
                <li>Added code to check for model errors and display a flag next to any required field that was not completed or contained incorrect information.</li>
                <li>
                    Added functionality to enable users to save their location to the database and visit a page to display all saved locations.
                    This also enabled a diary system within the application. This could not have been achieved without using routing.
                </li>
                <li>Added ‘Create Spreadsheet’ functionality to all gridviews for reporting.</li>
                <li>Added filtering functionality to most gridviews to assist in finding required information.</li>
                <li>Carried out extensive handover to new member of staff.</li>
                <li>Created user documentation in the form of web pages to allow viewing of this online.</li>
                <li>Wrote an extensive coding standards and procedures document.</li>
                <li>Added Unit Tests for all data access classes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>04/13 - 11/13 : Infor - C# ASP.NET SQL Server Developer</h5>

            <p>
                A contract to develop an ASP.NET website to interact with legacy technologies that created licence keys for their enterprise software.

            </p>

            <h5>10/12 – 03/13 : Romans Group – C# ASP.NET SQL Server Developer</h5>

            <p>
                I was invited back to Romans by a Director to be a part of a large and complex mission critical project to redevelop the primary Romans website using Entity Framework,
                AJAX, the Google Maps API, a great deal of client-side scripting, some WCF services and another third party API.
            </p>

            <h5>05/12 – 08/12  : Marston Book Services Ltd – C# ASP.NET Web Application Developer</h5>

            <p>
                A contract to add functionality to an intranet application. In addition to specification changes, I introduced object orientation, n-tier design and CSS, cutting development
                time and improving look and feel. I also made major changes to the data layer which reduce server overheads and recommended security improvements. I also amended SSRS reports.
            </p>
