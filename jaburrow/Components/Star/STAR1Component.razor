                A requirement was raised to add some UI to an existing application to
                assist with compliance with the Consumer Duty regulations
                from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to manage and report
                on Vulnerable Clients. The request was originally to add one checkbox and one
                textbox to a current application.

                The current application uses very old technology and is very hard to work with.

                Doing so made me realise that the UI requested was utterly inadequate for the recording of
                vulnerabilities in line with the FCA’s requirements so I asked my boss for permission
                to prototype an application which would provide the necessary functionality. This was given.

                It transpired that they were using a spreadsheet to record this
                information but, as good as this spreadsheet was, it was not entirely
                fit for purpose. In addition to this it is obviously not ideal to
                have to try to produce reports from a spreadsheet.
