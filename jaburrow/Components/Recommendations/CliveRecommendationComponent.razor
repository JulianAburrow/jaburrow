            &ldquo;Julian has been engaged with Marston on several separate and contract extensions as a principal developer on our subscriptions platform.
            Working tightly with the internal development team Julian has played a key role and lead in development of several key projects as well as providing
            support of the platform to end-users. Being able to engage with management, technical staff and end-users for analysis, through development, deployment
            and training have been a clear ROI with his involvement with Marston.  I would recommend Julian for development roles from developer through leading a team
            for his broad experience.&ldquo;
