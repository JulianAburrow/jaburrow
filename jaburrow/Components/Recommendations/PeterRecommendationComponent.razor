            &ldquo;Julian brought to the table a unique combination of excellent programming skills, an ability to see things from the customer’s perspective
            (which is so important to us), a sharp and focused mind, the talent to articulate and present his thoughts to a wide variety of stakeholders
            and a personable and enthusiastic character, all of which were greatly appreciated during his contracting time with us.
            Additionally he has a work ethic that goes beyond just ‘getting the job done’ in that he demonstrates a genuine interest
            and desire to understand the company’s goals, which unfortunately seems to be a characteristic sadly lacking in many contractors today.
            The next time I have a contracting role, Julian will be top of my list.&ldquo;
