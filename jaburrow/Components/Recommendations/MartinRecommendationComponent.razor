        <MudText Class="mb-4">(Contract Rollout Team Leader at Portsmouth City Council)</MudText>

        <MudText Class="mb-4">
            &ldquo;I was Julian's manager at Portsmouth City Council but to say I managed him would be wrong.
            Julian required virtually no supervision whatsoever, just a schedule of visits for the day and he was off.
            He would always complete all his work, including documentation, before any of the other
            6 members of the team and always either requested more or volunteered to
            help out where others were struggling.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;Julians application to the task in hand and his ability to deliver quality results
            at speed would be an asset to any team.&rdquo;
        </MudText>

        <MudText>
            &ldquo;Since working together Julian and I have remained firm friends and I have found that his
            integrity and honesty also extend into his personal life. I would have absolutely no hesitation
            in working with him again - or recommending him to any prospective employer.&rdquo;
